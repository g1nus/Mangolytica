# Mangolytica

React app offering a front-end interface for viewing data about streamers activities on Twitch and Twitter. This app connects to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for Google authentication and [Twadapter](https://github.com/g1nus/Twadapter) for fetching data about the streamers.


## Installation and setup

First of all clone the repo and then run: ```npm install```


Then you must set the `firebaseConfig` and the API endpoint in the config file (you can find an example [here](https://github.com/g1nus/Mangolytica/blob/main/src/config.example.js)).

Finally, you can run the app by running: ```npm start```
